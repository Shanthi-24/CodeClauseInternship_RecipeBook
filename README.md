# CodeClauseInternship_RecipeBook
The Recipe Book is a simple yet interactive application developed as part of the CodeClause Internship program. The main objective of this project is to create a digital platform where users can store, view, and manage their favorite recipes in an organized manner.
The project allows users to:

Add new recipes with details such as title, ingredients, preparation steps, and (optionally) an image.

View existing recipes in a structured format.

Search or filter recipes based on keywords like dish name or ingredient.

Edit or delete recipes (in advanced versions).

âœ¨ Purpose

Cooking is an essential skill, and recipes are often scattered across books, notes, or the internet. This Recipe Book application provides a centralized, user-friendly platform for storing and managing recipes digitally, making it easy for users to access and share them anytime.

ðŸ”§ Technology Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for a web version)

Backend (optional): Node.js / Flask / Django for dynamic features

Database (optional): MySQL, MongoDB, or JSON for storage

Alternative: Java (Swing/JavaFX) or Python (Tkinter) for desktop app

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

Understanding of basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Hands-on experience with web development / GUI programming.

Practice in project structuring, coding standards, and version control (GitHub).

Improved problem-solving and design skills through implementing search and filter features.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The Recipe Book project is a beginner-friendly yet practical application that demonstrates essential concepts of software development. It not only enhances coding skills but also produces a useful tool that can be expanded into a full-fledged cooking/recipe management app in the future.
